This repository contains the code and notebooks developed for my thesis project, which focuses on classifying skin lesions to detect melanoma using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project compares the performance of a Custom-Built CNN with two pretrained models, VGG19 and EfficientNetB0.

Datasets Used

1. **Melanoma Cancer Image Dataset (Kaggle)**
   - **Description:** Contains 13,879 images classified as benign or malignant.
   - **Usage:** Training, validation, and testing.

2. **HAM10000 Dataset**
   - **Description:** Includes images of skin lesions, filtered to focus on benign and melanoma classes for this project.
   - **Usage:** Evaluation and additional testing. Also for gender-specific performances
